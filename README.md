## Hi there 👋
I'm Phát Đào, a Cybersecurity Student based in Vietnam.

I enjoy working with data, specifically using SQL.

I study and secure whatever I can explore.

If a vulnerability pops into my head, chances are I'll research it and patch it.

My main tech stack is SQL, C#, and Git. My favorite tools are GitHub, SQL Server, and terminal-based utilities

I’ve built several public repos, but privately... it’s probably much more at this point as I continue to dive deeper into Cybersecurity
